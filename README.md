# MétEX - The Paris Métro Experience

MétEX is a virtual tour of the Paris Métro, which I originally developed in Flash and ASP.net for my university final-year project.

I have now rebuilt the site in Ruby on Rails and HTML5, and will continue developing new features and updating the content. Please feel free to report bugs or suggest new features.

You can explore the following version of MétEX:
* [The currently-updated version](http://metex.sblorgh.org/)
* [The original university version](http://metex-uni.sblorgh.org/)

The PHP version has been discontinued and is no longer live.

Have fun exploring the Paris Métro!
