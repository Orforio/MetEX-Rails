# MétEX-Rails - The Paris Métro Experience

MétEX is a virtual tour of the Paris Métro, which I originally developed in Flash and ASP.net for my university final-year project.

This is the rebuilt Ruby on Rails and HTML5 version, which I have abandoned in favour of my Angular port, which I am actively maintaining.
